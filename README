Python Version: 3.6.5
Required Packages:
  Pandas

Installation Instruction:
  I recommend installing miniconda or anaconda and running SHADDAI
  within a virtual environment

  conda create -n shaddai python=3.6.5 pandas

  Once the environment has been installed, run SHADDAI by running
  run_shaddai $1 $2
  $1 is required and is the path to the input file
  $2 is required if the PDSFileList.pkl file is missing or needs to be
     updated due to a new release from the PDS.
     Updated the .pkl file will increase run time

  For now all downloads are saved under output/TODAYSDATA/[rgram/geom]
